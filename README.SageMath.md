These instructions may be helpful for running this code base in SageMath.

SageMath is based on Python and it is comparatively easy to run
the code in this project under SageMath, either via command-line
or interactively.

To run a particular algorithm on the command-line, simply run something like:

```
sage deutsch.py  # or any of the other algorithms.
```

To start SageMath and have all the code preloaded, including
the accelerator library (`xgates`), this may be a way to do it:
###   Prepare a file `startup.py`
