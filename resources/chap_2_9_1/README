The file Pauli_Representation.pdf contains a derivation of the
Pauli representation of single or multi-qubit state density matrices.

    # Every qubit (rho) can be put in the Pauli Representation,
    # which is this Sum over i from 0 to 3 inclusive, representing
    # the four Pauli matrices (including the Identity):
    #
    #                  3
    #    rho = 1/2 * Sum(c_i * Pauli_i)
    #                 i=0
    #

And for multiple qubits:

    # Every rho can be put in the 2-qubit Pauli representation,
    # which is this Sum over i, j from 0 to 3 inclusive, representing
    # the four Pauli matrices (including the Identity):
    #
    #                 3
    #    rho = 1/4 * Sum(c_ij * (Pauli_i kron Pauli_j))
    #                i,j=0
    #
    # To compute the various factors c_ij, we multiply the Pauli
    # tensor products with the density matrix and take the trace. This
    # trace is the computed factor
